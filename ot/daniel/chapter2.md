# Chapter 2

## The Court Magicians

> In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. (Daniel 2:1-3)

The wording here seems to indicate that this episode occurred during Daniel's three year training program in preparation for court service. Nebuchadnezzar had repeatedly dreamed the same dream which keeps him awake at night, so he confers with a group of court servants of specific occupations.

### Magicians

The Hebrew word here is *chartom*, and generally means diviner, astrologer, or magician. The same word is used in reference to the court officials in the Egyptian empire whom the Pharaoh sent for to interpret his own dream (the dream which Joseph eventually interpreted that indicated a famine was on the way). The magicians in Pharaoh's court at the time of Moses replicating his miracles were also *chartom*.

### Astrologers

The Hebrew word here is *ashshaph*, and is more specific to the astrology aspect of these magic arts. This word only appears in the book of Daniel.

### Sorcerers

The Hebrew word here is *kashaph*, which has a more occult flavor; it's meaning is more akin to our idea of witchcraft. In addition to *chartom*, there were also *kashaph* in Pharaoh's court dueling with Moses. God's laws as recorded in the Torah have specific references to *kashaph*:

> Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live (Exodus 22:18)

> There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a **witch**, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee. (Deuteronomy 18:10-12)

The evil King Manasseh of Judah was guilty of violating the specific statute from Deuteronomy; the author takes care to tick off his offenses point by point (2 Chronicles 33:6).

Of the job descriptions listed so far, *kashaph* is the most reviled in God's law.

### Chaldeans

These were an ethnic group of peoples living under the dominion of the Babylonians and who were generally considered the wisest men in the land, at least when compared to other groups. There's no indication from this particular passage if they were simply "wise men" or if their wisdom came from supernatural or occult practices.

## The Test

> Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. (Daniel 2:4-6)

Incidentally, from when the Chaldeans respond "in Syriack" onward, the text is written in Aramaic instead of Hebrew. The rest of Daniel's historical narrative will be in Aramaic (through Chapter 7), and resumes Hebrew for Daniel's prophetic portion.

The magicians naturally ask for the king to tell them his dream, so that they can discern the interpretation. But Nebuchadnezzar throws them a curveball, claiming that he doesn't remember the dream, and that they must tell him what his dream was, too. Not only that, but if they fail, he will execute them and destroy their property (the "dunghill" theme is one used often by Nebuchadnezzar, apparently).

There is some debate as to whether or not Nebuchadnezzar was bluffing, and only claimed not to remember the dream when he actually did, so that he would know for sure whether these magicians were genuine when they responded. The view that he was bluffing seems reinforced by the next exchange:

> They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. (Daniel 2:7-9)

We see here for the first time that Nebuchadnezzar distrusts the motives and means of these court magicians and means to either prove them genuine or eliminate them; he will not put up with any strategies to delay the execution of his decree until they can divine his dream through some form of subterfuge. It's basically a "put up or shut up" ultimatum. These magicians were apparently part of the court for some time, and were inherited by Nebuchadnezzar from his late father, and they were not used to such demands from the royalty, and they say so:

> The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. (Daniel 2:10-11)

In the same breath they admit they are not capable of meeting the king's request by affirming that there is not a living soul upon the earth who can (which is true, as Daniel will testify shortly), while also imputing wrong to the king for even considering to ask such a thing. This was a big mistake on their part:

> For this cause the king was angry and furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. (Daniel 2:12)

By speaking presumptuously they expedited their own destruction.

## Enter Daniel

> And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. (Daniel 2:13)

The decree from Nebuchadnezzar was inclusive of all who fit the job description of a "wise man," which apparently included Daniel and his three friends (Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah). Even though they may have been wrapping up their three-year introductory training period for court service, they had already shown skill in the areas consistent with those of the court magicians. At least they achieved the same results, if they didn't use the same methods.

> Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon: He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation. (Daniel 2:14-16)

This was a gutsy move by Daniel. After learning all the details from Arioch, Daniel presents himself to Nebuchadnezzar and makes a committment to deliver what the king wants. There is no margin for error here: failure to satisfy Nebuchadnezzar will spell death for him, his friends, and every other wise man in Babylon. This was a huge step of faith.

> Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azaraiah, his companions: That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. (Daniel 2:17-18)

Imagine being one of Daniel's friends when Daniel shows up and tells them that a) the king decreed that all wise men should be destroyed ("which includes us, boys") unless they can both tell him his dream and interpret it, and b) that Daniel already promised the king that they would do just that for him. No pressure, guys.

But they do the right thing: they go to God and ask for his mercy.

> Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. (Daniel 2:19)

Daniel receives both the dream and the interpretation in his own dream, and what follows is a Psalm of Daniel:

> Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. I thank thee and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom adn might, and has made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter. (Daniel 2:20-23)

Daniel attributes the "wisdom and might" that were given him to God himself, and praises God as:

1. The one who changes times and seasons
2. The one who sets up and removes kings
3. The one who gives wisdom to the wise
4. The one who gives knowledge to the understanding
5. The revealer of deep and secret things
6. The one who knows what lies in darkness
7. The one in whom light dwells
