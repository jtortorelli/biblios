# Chapter 2

## The Court Magicians

> In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. (Daniel 2:1-3)

The wording here seems to indicate that this episode occurred during Daniel's three year training program in preparation for court service. Nebuchadnezzar had repeatedly dreamed the same dream which keeps him awake at night, so he confers with a group of court servants of specific occupations.

### Magicians

The Hebrew word here is *chartom*, and generally means diviner, astrologer, or magician. The same word is used in reference to the court officials in the Egyptian empire whom the Pharaoh sent for to interpret his own dream (the dream which Joseph eventually interpreted that indicated a famine was on the way). The magicians in Pharaoh's court at the time of Moses replicating his miracles were also *chartom*.

### Astrologers

The Hebrew word here is *ashshaph*, and is more specific to the astrology aspect of these magic arts. This word only appears in the book of Daniel.

### Sorcerers

The Hebrew word here is *kashaph*, which has a more occult flavor; it's meaning is more akin to our idea of witchcraft. In addition to *chartom*, there were also *kashaph* in Pharaoh's court dueling with Moses. God's laws as recorded in the Torah have specific references to *kashaph*:

> Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live (Exodus 22:18)

> There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a **witch**, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee. (Deuteronomy 18:10-12)

The evil King Manasseh of Judah was guilty of violating the specific statute from Deuteronomy; the author takes care to tick off his offenses point by point (2 Chronicles 33:6).

Of the job descriptions listed so far, *kashaph* is the most reviled in God's law.

### Chaldeans

These were an ethnic group of peoples living under the dominion of the Babylonians and who were generally considered the wisest men in the land, at least when compared to other groups. There's no indication from this particular passage if they were simply "wise men" or if their wisdom came from supernatural or occult practices.

## The Test

> Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. (Daniel 2:4-6)

Incidentally, from when the Chaldeans respond "in Syriack" onward, the text is written in Aramaic instead of Hebrew. The rest of Daniel's historical narrative will be in Aramaic (through Chapter 7), and resumes Hebrew for Daniel's prophetic portion.

The magicians naturally ask for the king to tell them his dream, so that they can discern the interpretation. But Nebuchadnezzar throws them a curveball, claiming that he doesn't remember the dream, and that they must tell him what his dream was, too. Not only that, but if they fail, he will execute them and destroy their property (the "dunghill" theme is one used often by Nebuchadnezzar, apparently).
