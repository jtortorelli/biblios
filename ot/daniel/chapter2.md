# Chapter 2

## The Court Magicians

> In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. (Daniel 2:1-3)

The wording here seems to indicate that this episode occurred during Daniel's three year training program in preparation for court service. Nebuchadnezzar had repeatedly dreamed the same dream which keeps him awake at night, so he confers with a group of court servants of specific occupations.

### Magicians

The Hebrew word here is *chartom*, and generally means diviner, astrologer, or magician. The same word is used in reference to the court officials in the Egyptian empire whom the Pharaoh sent for to interpret his own dream (the dream which Joseph eventually interpreted that indicated a famine was on the way). The magicians in Pharaoh's court at the time of Moses replicating his miracles were also *chartom*.

### Astrologers

The Hebrew word here is *ashshaph*, and is more specific to the astrology aspect of these magic arts. This word only appears in the book of Daniel.

### Sorcerers

The Hebrew word here is *kashaph*, which has a more occult flavor; it's meaning is more akin to our idea of witchcraft. In addition to *chartom*, there were also *kashaph* in Pharaoh's court dueling with Moses. God's laws as recorded in the Torah have specific references to *kashaph*:

> Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live (Exodus 22:18)

> There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a **witch**, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee. (Deuteronomy 18:10-12)

The evil King Manasseh of Judah was guilty of violating the specific statute from Deuteronomy; the author takes care to tick off his offenses point by point (2 Chronicles 33:6).

Of the job descriptions listed so far, *kashaph* is the most reviled in God's law.

### Chaldeans

These were an ethnic group of peoples living under the dominion of the Babylonians and who were generally considered the wisest men in the land, at least when compared to other groups. There's no indication from this particular passage if they were simply "wise men" or if their wisdom came from supernatural or occult practices.

## The Test

> Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation. The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. (Daniel 2:4-6)

Incidentally, from when the Chaldeans respond "in Syriack" onward, the text is written in Aramaic instead of Hebrew. The rest of Daniel's historical narrative will be in Aramaic (through Chapter 7), and resumes Hebrew for Daniel's prophetic portion.

The magicians naturally ask for the king to tell them his dream, so that they can discern the interpretation. But Nebuchadnezzar throws them a curveball, claiming that he doesn't remember the dream, and that they must tell him what his dream was, too. Not only that, but if they fail, he will execute them and destroy their property (the "dunghill" theme is one used often by Nebuchadnezzar, apparently).

There is some debate as to whether or not Nebuchadnezzar was bluffing, and only claimed not to remember the dream when he actually did, so that he would know for sure whether these magicians were genuine when they responded. The view that he was bluffing seems reinforced by the next exchange:

> They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. (Daniel 2:7-9)

We see here for the first time that Nebuchadnezzar distrusts the motives and means of these court magicians and means to either prove them genuine or eliminate them; he will not put up with any strategies to delay the execution of his decree until they can divine his dream through some form of subterfuge. It's basically a "put up or shut up" ultimatum. These magicians were apparently part of the court for some time, and were inherited by Nebuchadnezzar from his late father, and they were not used to such demands from the royalty, and they say so:

> The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. (Daniel 2:10-11)

In the same breath they admit they are not capable of meeting the king's request by affirming that there is not a living soul upon the earth who can (which is true, as Daniel will testify shortly), while also imputing wrong to the king for even considering to ask such a thing. This was a big mistake on their part:

> For this cause the king was angry and furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. (Daniel 2:12)

By speaking presumptuously they expedited their own destruction.

## Enter Daniel

> And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. (Daniel 2:13)

The decree from Nebuchadnezzar was inclusive of all who fit the job description of a "wise man," which apparently included Daniel and his three friends (Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah). Even though they may have been wrapping up their three-year introductory training period for court service, they had already shown skill in the areas consistent with those of the court magicians. At least they achieved the same results, if they didn't use the same methods.

> Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon: He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation. (Daniel 2:14-16)

This was a gutsy move by Daniel. After learning all the details from Arioch, Daniel presents himself to Nebuchadnezzar and makes a committment to deliver what the king wants. There is no margin for error here: failure to satisfy Nebuchadnezzar will spell death for him, his friends, and every other wise man in Babylon. This was a huge step of faith.

> Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azaraiah, his companions: That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. (Daniel 2:17-18)

Imagine being one of Daniel's friends when Daniel shows up and tells them that a) the king decreed that all wise men should be destroyed ("which includes us, boys") unless they can both tell him his dream and interpret it, and b) that Daniel already promised the king that they would do just that for him. No pressure, guys.

But they do the right thing: they go to God and ask for his mercy.

> Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. (Daniel 2:19)

Daniel receives both the dream and the interpretation in his own dream, and what follows is a Psalm of Daniel:

> Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. I thank thee and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom adn might, and has made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter. (Daniel 2:20-23)

Daniel attributes the "wisdom and might" that were given him to God himself, and praises God as:

1. The one who changes times and seasons
2. The one who sets up and removes kings
3. The one who gives wisdom to the wise
4. The one who gives knowledge to the understanding
5. The revealer of deep and secret things
6. The one who knows what lies in darkness
7. The one in whom light dwells

## The Dream

> Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation. Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation. (Daniel 2:24-25)

It's interesting that Arioch tries to take credit for having "found" Daniel, when in fact Daniel has been taking initiative throughout this ordeal. He also makes a point of saying that Daniel is a captive from Judah, as if to further spite the court magicians, who are all either native Babylonians or Chaldeans.

> The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make  known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king. (Daniel 2:27)

Daniel lists off the same or similar job descriptions here, although now we're dealing with Aramaic, and the words are slightly different.

| English Word | Aramaic | Meaning(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wise Men | *chakkiym* | wise, wise man, esp. a magician (corresponds to Hebrew *chakam*) |
| Astrologer | *ashshaph* | conjurer, enchanter, necromancer, astrologer, magician (same as Hebrew *ashshaph*) |
| Magician | *chartom* | magician, astrologer (same as Hebrew *chartom*) |
| Soothsayer | *gezar* | to cut (as in quarrying, to cut from stone), to find out, determine (corresponds to Hebrew *gazar*) |

> But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. (Daniel 2:28)

Daniel gives all credit to God for revealing the dream to him and what it pertains to. This is a momentous occassion, because God has seen fit to deliver to Nebuchadnezzar, a Gentile king, a vision of what shall occur in the "latter days," or what we would call the end times.

> Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these; As for thee, O King, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass. But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart. (Daniel 2:28-2:30)

Daniel reiterates that the dream benefits the king by making future events known to him. He also reiterates that Daniel did not "earn" the privilege of knowing the dream because of any wisdom he had, but to preserve him and the other wise men and for the king's own enlightenment. God seems particularly interested with King Nebuchadnezzar's heart, as we shall see later in Daniel.

>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible. This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. 

The dream itself was the vision of an image, or a statue, of a being composed of different metals.

| Component | Metal|
| --- | --- |
| Head | Gold |
| Chest & Arms | Silver |
| Belly & Thighs | Brass |
| Legs | Iron |
| Feet | Iron & Clay |

Then a rock cut without hands (sound familiar?) strikes the statue at its feet and the entire thing crumbles to dust and is scattered until it disappears completely. The rock becomes a mountain which fills the whole earth.

## The Interpretation

> This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold. And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise. And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure. (Daniel 2:36-45)

### A Succession of World Empires

The provocative implication of this dream is that it represents a succession of world dominating empires that will culminate with the arrival of God's kingdom that he will set up on the earth. That is to say, at this juncture of history, there are only four empires to go before God brings a conclusion to human history and institutes his forever kingdom.

### The First Empire

Daniel states that these empires follow one after the other, beginning with Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar (i.e., Babylon) is represented by the gold, and is the most regal and kingly of the empires, and is specifically identified as having had his authority given to him by God. This is attested to by Jeremiah:

> Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters; I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me. And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given im also to serve him. And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him. (Jeremiah 27:4-7)

God has not only given authority over peoples and nations to Nebuchadnezzar, but authority over nature as well!

### The Second and Third Empires

Following Babylon is another empire represented by silver, and thus less regal; this is generally regarded as the Persian empire. And after silver comes bronze, an even less precious metal; this is regarded as Greece. The interpretation that the next two empires are Persia and Greece is born out by comments made by the Angel of the Lord to Daniel in Chapter 10:

> ...And now I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come. (Daniel 10:20)

This remark was made "in the third year of Cyrus king of Persia" (Daniel 10:1), or about 556 BC. The city of Babylon did not fall until 539 BC, or about 17 years after the fact.

### The Fourth Empire

The fourth world empire is represented by legs of iron. Iron is not a precious metal, but is frequently used in Scripture to allude to strength, especially ruthless strength, and as a metal against which other materials are broken. This refers to the Roman Empire. Just as the fourth empire consists of two wholly separate legs, so the Roman Empire was split in two: the Western Empire headquartered in Rome, and the Eastern Empire in Byzantine (later Constantinople, then Istanbul).

#### The Empire Divided and Mixed

Curiously the fourth empire is split into two distinct "sections." The legs are wholly iron, but the feet are of iron mixed with clay; they retain some of the strength, but they are weak, as well.

In another curious turn of phrase, Daniel says that "they," that is the fourth empire, "shall mingle themselves with the seed of men." This would seem to imply that in this latter phase, the fourth empire includes some which would not be considered "seed of men." It's possible this is an allusion to the return of the strange, supernatural beings known as the "Nephilim" (Genesis 6 and elsewhere).

In terms of real world empires, this would mean that the Roman Empire will reform itself, but will not be as strong as it once was. We consider this to be Rome because, unlike the previous world empires, Rome was never conquered; it was split into smaller "sub-empires." The first phase of Rome is past, while this second phase is yet future.

#### Many Kings

God arrives to set up his kingdom "in the days of *these kings*," plural. This could be a reference to the ten kings alluded to in Chapter 7. In Chapter 7, the same succession of world empires is described, but using wild animals as symbols instead of precious metals. You could say that Chapter 2's vision is of the world empires from man's perspective, while Chapter 7 is the same vision from God's perspective. The fourth empire is represented by a "terrible beast" which is not identified, but which has ten horns, identified as ten kings (Daniel 7:24). Just as there were ten horns on the fourth beast (at least initially), so the image has ten toes on its feet.

### God's Kingdom

When God arrives to set up his kingdom, he will absolutely obliterate all traces of the previous kingdoms. It's implied here that none of the kingdoms up to that point had actually disappeared; they were merely absorbed into the kingdom that overtook them. This time around, though, no human agency will stand to inherit these kingdoms, and they will be scattered like chaff and come to nothing. The rock cut without hands strikes the statue at its feet, further substantiating the timing of this event; during the "second phase" of the fourth empire.

The stone cut without hands is an allusion to Jesus Christ, and he speaks of himself using these terms:

> Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken; **but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.** (Matthew 21:42-44, emphasis added)

The fact that the stone is cut "without hands" indicates the absence of human interference. The altars built to the Lord in the tabernacle were made with unhewn stones, so that man could not say he contributed to God's design. The circumcision made "without hands" is a spiritual action that God takes in a believer, and is absent of any "work" on his or her part.

Just as the four empires are not to be inherited by any human agency, neither will any human agency stand to inherit God's kingdom, because it will stand forever.

### The Gap

If the historical representation of the image and its constituent parts is accurate, then we are currently living in the region between the legs and the feet (the shin or ankle, if you will). Although there is no gap mentioned in the dream here - the assumption is that all of these empires follow each other immediately in time - there is a definite gap in which are are currently living called the "Church Age." This gap was not foretold by Scripture because it was hidden from the Old Testament prophets, but was revealed to us living in the time between the first and second comings of Christ. Paul alludes to this mystery as one kept from previous generations in his epistles:

> [T]he mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory... (Colossians 1:26-27)

> [B]y revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ bythe gospel... (Ephesians 3:3-6)

Jesus himself makes mention of the mystery that was hidden from the prophets of old:

> For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. (Matthew 13:17)

Jesus himself also set the precedent of reading the gap into Old Testament prophecy when he began his ministry in the gospel of Luke:

> And Jesus returnd in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about. And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias [i.e., Isaiah]. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fasted on him. And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. (Luke 4:14-21)

What you may not realize is that Jesus stopped reading in the middle of a passage. The full passage from Isaiah reads as follows:

> The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, **and the day of vengeance of our God**... (Isaiah 61:1-2)

Jesus stopped reading on a comma, not a period. That comma has lasted more than two thousand years. So while the prophecy may read as a continuous chain of events without pause, there is, in fact, a pause, in which we are living. This pause corresponds to the boundary between the legs of iron and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay.

### Summary

| Section | Metal | Empire | Current Focus of Power | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Head | Gold | Babylon | Iraq | Past |
| Chest & Arms | Silver | Persia | Iran | Past |
| Belly & Thighs | Brass | Greece | Greece | Past |
