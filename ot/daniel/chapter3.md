# Chapter 3

## Nebuchadnezzar's Statue

> Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. (Daniel 3:1)

It's not known exactly how long after the previous chapter this is taking place. It has been suggested that Nebuchadnezzar let Daniel's words concerning him from his dream go to his head, and so he is building an image similar to the one that appeared in his dream, but of solid gold.

If you take a cubit to be about 18 inches (the typical length of a man's forearm), then this statue would have been 90 feet tall and 9 feet across. (That's a rather thin statue, although the height may include a pedestal of some kind.) The location of the image was in a plain, or an open space, away from any temples or structures. The current location of this plain is unknown, and there differing views on whether or not it was actually within the walls of Babylon.

> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Then the princes, the governors, the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. (Daniel 3:2-3)

Basically every one holding official office was required to attend the dedication ceremony for this image. That would include Daniel and his three friends at this point. Notice that there is no reference to civilians or common people; only officials are named in this edict.

> Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzr the king hath set up: And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. (Daniel 3:4-7)

Once all the required persons are assembled, as soon as the music starts playing they are commanded to worship the statue (and Nebuchadnezzar by proxy, it would seem) under pain of death. Babylon did have a number of buildings that were essentially giant kilns, such as those used for making bricks and pottery, but with cryptic inscriptions that indicated that they were also used as instruments of execution as well.

## The Jews Are Accused

> Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews. They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever. Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image: And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. (Daniel 3:8-12)

The Chaldeans are quick to accuse Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego of failing to obey the king's decree. Note how they are particularly accusing the Jews that the king has setup over the affairs of Babylon (according to the end of the previous chapter). It seems obvious from the context that the Chaldeans are jealous of the primacy of these Jewish officials over other Babylonians and Chaldeans, and that they mean to remove them by entrapping them in this decree.

While nothing is offered via Scripture as to the motivations for the statue or the decree, it's possible that this may have been the Chaldeans' scheme all along, and they enticed Nebuchadnezzar to build the statue in the first place. This seems to be a pattern following Daniel and his friends. Under the Persian empire, where Daniel again holds high office, similar intrigues are commited by the Medians in Darius' court in an effort to remove Daniel, rooted in a similar jealousy.

### Where's Daniel?

At this point you should be asking yourself, "Where's Daniel in all of this?" He was not explicitly accused, and Scripture has no account of Daniel being thrown into a fiery furnace. Only three explanations are possible: 1) Daniel bowed down and worshipped with the rest of the officials, 2) Daniel was somehow exempt from the edict, or 3) Daniel was simply not in Babylon when these events occurred. Naturally the third explanation is the most likely. As a holder of high office, answering to Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel may have had opportunities to travel outside the boundaries of Babylon on the king's business. It's possible that on one such absence the Chaldeans' put their plot into action. Daniel, after all, enjoyed the confidences of the king himself, and would have protested the plan to make everyone worship his statue. With him gone, the Chaldeans had freedom to speak to the king without interference and entice him to build a statue.
