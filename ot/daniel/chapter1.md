## The Siege of Jerusalem

> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. (Daniel 1:1)

### The Major Players

#### Jehoiakim
Jehoiakim was the son of Josiah, King of Judah. Josiah was killed in battle against Pharaoh Necho at Megiddo, and the Jews elevated Josiah's son Jehoahaz as king in his stead. Jehoahaz only reigned three months and did evil in the sight of the Lord. Pharaoh Necho deposed Jehoahaz and imprisoned him in Riblah in the land of Hamath and required a tribute from the Jews of a hundred talents of silver a one talent of gold. Necho put Josiah's other son Eliakim on the throne and renamed him Jehoiakim. Necho returned to Egypt.  Jehoiakim reigned in Jerusalem for eleven years (609-598 BC) and also did evil in the sight of the Lord (2 Kings 23:29-37).

#### Nebuchadnezzar
Son and successor of Nabopolassar, King of Babylon. He led the armies of Babylon against Egypt led by Pharaoh Necho and defeated them at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC. Afterwards he turned his attention to Judah; the Scripture says he came up against Jerusalem in the third year of Jehoiakim's reign. To prevent the destruction of Jerusalem, Jehoiakim submitted to Babylon and agreed to pay tribute. Nebuchadnezzar also took hostages back with him to Babylon:

> And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. (Daniel 1:2)

However, after three years, Jehoiakim rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, which precipitated a return trip on the part of the Babylonian armies, partly in response to the rebellion and partly as a judgment for Jehoiakim's evil acts. During this siege Jehoiakim died and was succeeded by his son Jehoiachin.

Jehoiachin was only 18 when he took the throne and lasted three months before surrendering to Nebuchadnezzar. This surrender occurred in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign (597-596 BC). At this time Nebuchadnezzar took hostage *all* the ruling class in Jerusalem and took an additional ten thousand captives, leaving only the poor and the unskilled in the city. He placed Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle (Jehoiakim's brother) king instead and renamed him Zedekiah. Zedekiah was 21 years old when he took the throne and he reigned for eleven years before he, too, rebelled against Babylon.

Nebuchadnezzar returned to Jerusalem for the third time and laid siege to the city, a siege which lasted about two years, and caused a dire famine within the city. Zedekiah attempted to flee with his armies but was pursued and overtaken by Nebuchadnezzar in the plains of Jericho. As punishment his sons were slain before him, his eyes were put out and he was led to Babylon in chains. Nebuchadnezzar's captain Nebuzaradan returned to Jerusalem and burned the city, including the temple, with fire, and took all the remaining Jews captive. The walls were broken down and the city was left desolate until the time of Nehemiah. The year was 587 BC.

*The preceding is described in more detail in 2 Kings 24-25*

## The Hostages
> And the king [i.e., Nebuchadnezzar] spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes; children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. (Daniel 1:3-4)

Nebuchadnezzar desired to gather select commendable Israelites and train them to serve in his court at Babylon. The training was to be in the customs and language of the Chaldeans; it was assumed that these hostages were already well endowed with wisdom and knowledge on a variety of subjects.

Nebuchadnezzar desired servants who exhibited 6 special qualities:

1. There was no blemish
2. Well favoured
3. Skilful in all wisdom
4. Cunning in knowledge
5. Understanding science
6. Such as had ability in them

### The Chaldeans

The Chaldeans were a people that previously dwelled in Mesopotamia between the 9th and 6th centuries BC, and were absorbed into Babylon when that civilization rose to power. The Hebrew word is *kasdiy*, which according to Strong's refers to both the territory of the Chaldeans (or "Chaldees" in the KJV), the people, and to "those persons considered wisest in the land." Hence the association of the Chaldeans with the magicians and astrologers in the next chapter.

Chaldea as a region was first mentioned in Genesis as the homeland of Abraham, specifically Ur of the Chaldees (Genesis 11:28, 31). A band of Chaldeans was responsible for stealing Job's camels (Job 1:17). Afterwards they next appear most prominently as agents of Babylon sent to conquer Jerusalem (2 Kings 24). In prophecy, Babylon and Chaldea are used interchangeably.

### Special Diet

> And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. (Daniel 1:5)

Nebuchadnezzar allowed for these captives to eat of the same food and drink the same wine that he himself had on a daily basis. This regimen was to continue for three years. Incidentally, at the end of three years, Nebuchadnezzar would be back in Judea making his second siege against Jerusalem.

## Daniel and Company

> Now among these were the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego. (Daniel 1:6-7)

The Babylonians renamed the captives to obliterate the name of God and substituted them with names that praised their own pagan gods:

| Hebrew Name | Meaning | Babylonian Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Daniel | God is My Judge | Belteshazzar | Bel Protects His Life |
| Hananiah | God Has Favoured | Shadrach | Command of Aku |
| Mishael | Who Is Like God | Meshach | Who Is Like Aku |
| Azariah | God Has Helped | Abednego | Servant of Nebo |

Interestingly, although the book of Daniel continues to refer to him by his Hebrew name (occasionally acknowledging his Babylonian name), his three friends are henceforth referred to exclusively by their Babylonian names, and are remembered by them today.
