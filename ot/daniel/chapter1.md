# Chapter 1

## The Siege of Jerusalem

> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. (Daniel 1:1)

### The Major Players

#### Jehoiakim
Jehoiakim was the son of Josiah, King of Judah. Josiah was killed in battle against Pharaoh Necho at Megiddo, and the Jews elevated Josiah's son Jehoahaz as king in his stead. Jehoahaz only reigned three months and did evil in the sight of the Lord. Pharaoh Necho deposed Jehoahaz and imprisoned him in Riblah in the land of Hamath and required a tribute from the Jews of a hundred talents of silver a one talent of gold. Necho put Josiah's other son Eliakim on the throne and renamed him Jehoiakim. Necho returned to Egypt.  Jehoiakim reigned in Jerusalem for eleven years (609-598 BC) and also did evil in the sight of the Lord (2 Kings 23:29-37).

#### Nebuchadnezzar
Son and successor of Nabopolassar, King of Babylon. He led the armies of Babylon against Egypt led by Pharaoh Necho and defeated them at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC. Afterwards he turned his attention to Judah; the Scripture says he came up against Jerusalem in the third year of Jehoiakim's reign. To prevent the destruction of Jerusalem, Jehoiakim submitted to Babylon and agreed to pay tribute. Nebuchadnezzar also took hostages back with him to Babylon:

> And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. (Daniel 1:2)

## The Hostages
> And the king [i.e., Nebuchadnezzar] spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed [i.e., Jehoiakim's seed], and of the princes; children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.

Nebuchadnezzar desired to gather select commendable Israelites and train them to serve in his court at Babylon. The training was to be in the customs and language of the Chaldeans; it was assumed that these hostages were already well endowed with wisdom and knowledge on a variety of subjects.
