# Chapter 1

## Sundry Times and Divers Manners
> God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.  
>   
> Hebrews 1:1-2  

The author begins with a general statement that in times past, at various junctures of history, by means of different methods, God spoke through prophets to "the fathers."

### The Fathers
This allusion to "the fathers" hints at the intended readership of this epistle; that is, Hebrew converts to Christianity; "Fathers" in this context would refer ultimately to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (or Israel). This is as opposed to the Pauline epistles, for example, which were written to Gentile churches scattered across Asia. This book will include numerous allusions to the Old Testament (the *Tanakh*, or *Septuagint* in the Greek), the Jews' primary authority for all things related to God.

### The Prophets
The word *prophet* simply means "spokesperson," although in this context it also connotes one who speaks specifically for God and/or one who can foretell the future. The "prophetic" writings of the Old Testament (the *nevi'im*) are primarily concerned with then-future events. In any case, these prophets were typically divinely ordained individuals, selected specifically by God to deliver his message at specific times and places throughout history.

## These Last Days
The word here in the Greek is *eschatos*, from which we get the word *eschatology*, or study of the end times. It carries the weight of finality; when we say "last," we really mean we're at the last of a succession. There are no more days after this. The first coming of Jesus Christ ushered in this period now known as the "latter days," because we understand this period to be the final chapter in the history of the earth. The doctrine of imminency - that Jesus could return at any moment to rapture his church - means that this chapter, the church period, could come to a close at any time, and the countdown to the second coming would begin. This has been the situation for 2000 years and counting.

## His Son
There is no ambiguity as to who this is referring to: none other than Jesus Christ, the second member of the Trinity, who is equally God and equally man in a mysterious union that cannot be fully grasped. God has spoken to us through Jesus in these last days; the advent of Jesus signaled the end of what can be called the "Old Testament period," when God spoke through the prophets. Technically, this period ended with John the Baptist, according to Jesus:

> The law and the prophets were until John [the Baptist]: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.  
>   
> Luke 16:16  

It is often pondered why God does not appear to speak to us in such vivid ways as he did in the Old Testament. Before, God spoke to Moses through a burning bush, to Job in a whirlwind, to Elijah in a still small voice, and to Samuel in a quite audible voice that he mistook for his mentor Eli. We don't hear many accounts of these kinds of events in our modern world. While we may indeed desire for God to speak to us in these ways - and it's not beyond him to do so - we must not forget that we have the sum of God's message for the world embodied in the gospel of Jesus Christ. He is the culmination of all that God spoke in time past and in Him the fullness of the Godhead dwells (Colossians 1:19). Anyone seeking to come closer to God should look no further than Jesus Christ.

### Heir of All Things
By suffering death on the cross, Christ ascended to a seat of glory and was made worthy of receiving the inheritance God set aside for him, i.e. everything. We are co-heirs with him if we share in his sufferings (Romans 8:17). While the world before Christ was under the dominion of Satan, Christ's death redeemed the world and his church unto himself. He will return to take physical possession of the earth beginning in Revelation 4; he alone is worthy to open the seven-sealed scroll, written within and on the backside - the title deed of the universe.

### By Whom Also He Made the Worlds
There should be no doubt left as to the divine nature of Jesus Christ. He claimed to be God in such a way the Pharisees attempted to stone him for blasphemy (John 8:56-59). Naturally, Jesus also preexisted his physical incarnation, and partook in the creation, as John so eloquently states at the beginning of his gospel:

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.  
>   
> John 1:1-3
