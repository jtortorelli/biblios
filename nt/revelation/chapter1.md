# Chapter 1
## John's Greeting
### A Singular Revelation
> The Revelation of Jesus Christ...  
>   
> Revelation 1:1  

This book is often incorrectly referred to as "Revelations" or "The Revelations." The Greek word used, *apokalypsis*, is a singular word, which means "revealing" or "unveiling." The many varied signs and events described herein constitute a singular revelation.

This book specifically contains the unveiling of Jesus Christ in the end times, at the second coming.

### Remembering
> The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him...  
>   
> Revelation 1:1  

The Revelation was delivered by God the Father to Jesus Christ the Son. This could imply that the Father had knowledge that the Son didn't. This is reinforced in the dialogue Jesus had with his disciples concerning the end times:

> But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.  
>   
> Matthew 24:36  

> But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, *neither the Son*, but the Father.  
>   
> Mark 13:32 (emphasis added)  

However, this would contradict the notion that Jesus Christ was both completely man and completely God, and therefore sharing in the qualities of God, including omniscience.

A more likely explanation is that Jesus chose to withhold this knowledge from himself. This is not a foreign concept, as God has said before that he would choose not to remember our sins:

> I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, *and will not remember thy sins*.  
>   
> Isaiah 43:25 (emphasis added)  

> And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and *I will remember their sin no more*.  
>   
> Jeremiah 31:34 (emphasis added)  

It may be through a similar act of "not remembering" that Jesus kept the knowledge of the Revelation from himself.

### Shortly
> ...to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass...  
>   
> Revelation 1:1  

The phrase "shortly come to pass" at first glance implies that the events described in this book will come to pass "soon"; that is, they are near to us in time. The fact that this has been written nearly 2000 years ago no doubt has been the cause of much cynicism from critics of the Scriptures:

> Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.  
>   
> 2 Peter 3:3-4  

However, the word "shortly," which is the Greek *en tachei*, can also mean "quickly," or "speedily."

> And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up **quickly**, and his chains fell off from his hands.  
>   
> Acts 12:7  

> And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee **quickly** out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.  
>   
> Acts 22:18  

The exhortations in these contexts is not necessarily to act "soon," but to act "quickly." The Greek root *tachos* literally means "speed." Therefore, the events described in this book are not required to happen *soon* after being written, but when they do happen, they will happen *quickly*.

### Signified by His Angel
> ...and he sent and signified it by his angel...  
>   
> Revelation 1:1  

We discover later in the book, following the vision of Jesus Christ and the Seven Letters to the Seven Churches, that John's guides through the ensuing visions are primarily angels.

God frequently uses angels to convey visions to his prophets. The word  *angelos* literally means "messenger," and is used as such elsewhere in Scripture.

The word "signified" is the Greek *semaino*, which according to Strong's means to "indicate", "give a sign", or "make known." This Revelation was delivered by an angel, who "made it known." The word can also be considered as a pun, as in the Revelation was "rendered into signs" (per Missler).

### John
> ...unto his servant John: who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.  
>   
> Revelation 1:1-2  

#### John the Apostle
John was one of the twelve apostles selected by Jesus, and one of the three apostles who were more intimate with Jesus, and was especially considered the most favored of the apostles by Jesus (granted, according to his own account).

As a reminder, the three apostles were Peter, John and his brother James. These three disciples were present at:

- The raising of Jairus' daughter (Luke 8:51)
- The Transfiguration of Christ (Matthew 17, Mark 9, Luke 9)
- The Olivet Discourse (Mark 13, also with Andrew)
- The Garden of Gethsemane (Mark 14:33)

Paul gave mention to the three disciples in Galatians:

> And when James, Cephas [i.e., Peter], and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.  
>   
> Galatians 2:9  

According to Mark 1, Peter and Andrew were the first disciples called by Jesus, followed soon after by James and John, the sons of Zebedee. All four of them were fishermen by trade, which  they left to follow Jesus. James and John were together nicknamed the *boanerges*, or "sons of thunder" (Mark 3:17). Notable passages highlighting their belligerent attitudes include:

- Attempting to forbid a man who was not a disciple of Jesus from casting out demons (Mark 9:38)
- Seeking permission from Jesus to cast fire down on a city of the Samaritans (Luke 9:54)
- Requesting to occupy seats to the left and right of Jesus' throne of glory (Mark 10:35)

John referred to himself in his gospel as the "disciple whom Jesus loved." He leaned against Jesus during the last supper (John 13:23) and he asked Jesus who it was that would betray him. At the foot of the cross, Jesus entrusted his mother Mary into John's care (John 21:20). After the resurrection, when the women had come to tell the disciples that the tomb was empty, Peter and John raced each other to the tomb (John 21:2). (John takes great pains to point out that he reached the tomb first.) When Jesus later discovers the apostles out fishing, John is the first to recognize Jesus (John 21:7). Jesus said to Peter, speaking of John:

> ...If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.  
>   
> John 21:22  

Although Jesus does not emphatically state that John will indeed "tarry" until Jesus returns, it is provocative that John is the only disciple who died a natural death; the other disciples were all martyred for their faith. In a sense, John did tarry until Jesus returned, in the vision given to John on Patmos, from which we received the Revelation.

Afterwards Peter and John were mentioned working together in Acts, especially in the healing of a lame man in front of the temple (Acts 3).

John is credited with having written 5 books of the New Testament: the gospel of John, the three epistles John 1, 2 and 3, and the Revelation.

#### Who Bare Record
John bore record of three specific things:

- The Word of God
- The Testimony of Jesus Christ
- All things that he saw

##### The Word of God
The inference here is fairly obvious. John was a witness of Jesus' ministry, which he described in his gospel. The "Word of God" that he bare record of is a reference to his own title for Jesus Christ which opens the gospel:

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  
>   
> John 1:1  

##### The Testimony of Jesus Christ
"Baring record" was a matter of preserving history, but the "testimony of Jesus Christ" is more specific: it is the gospel itself. It was because of the testimony of Jesus Christ that John was exiled to Patmos, as we'll see later in this chapter (Revelation 1:9).

##### All Things That He Saw
In this book John is commanded by Christ to "write the things which thou hast seen" (Revelation 1:19). Throughout the book John prefaces his words with "I saw." It can be inferred that John's visions in this book constitute the subject of this phrase: all things that he saw.

Note also that we have the assurance of Scripture here that John bore record of *all* things that he saw; nothing was overlooked. The only exceptions were the words of the Seven Thunders, which are sealed until the end times (Revelation 10:4); even then John wrote down the exact circumstances of that exchange.

### A Boast of a Blessing

> Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein...  
>   
>  Revelation 1:3  

This particular book of the Bible offers a unique blessing to two very specific groups of people:

- He that readeth (singular, individual)
- They that hear (plural)

Both groups are furthermore expected to keep (or obey) the words herein in order to receive the blessing.

The fact that this book blesses both the reader and the hearer who take it seriously and attend closely to its meaning shows that this book indeed deserves its place in the canon; a book not divinely inspired cannot offer a blessing to its reader. But it's not a free blessing; we must "keep those things which are written herein." But what things are those, and how do we keep them?

#### Keeping
The Greek word *tereo* simply means "to watch," but it's usage in Scripture takes on a broader range of meanings. It's most often used to refer to obeying commandments (e.g., "keep the commandments," "keep the faith"). It can refer to the "preserving" or "reservement" of beings for glory or judgment, respectively. It's also used to literally mean "keep" in reference to Paul's imprisonments.

A complete listing of *tereo* in the New Testament is in the appendix.

So in the context of this text, it may be safe to infer that the use of *tereo* means to preserve or to obey. But what exactly are we preserving or obeying? The verse only says "those things which are written herein," but what exactly does that encompass? We'll observe at the end of chapter 1 that Jesus exhorts John to "write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter" (1:19), which succinctly describes and organizes the contents of the entire book of Revelation. We'll get into more detail when we arrive at that verse.

### A Sense of Urgency

> ...for the time is at hand.  
>   
> Revelation 1:3  

In contrast to the usage of *en tachei* in verse 1, the Greek word rendered "is at hand" is *eggys*, which *does* imply that something is near both spatially and temporally. It's used frequently in the New Testament to refer to an approaching season (e.g. Matthew 24:32), the nearness of a physical location (e.g. Luke 19:11), and, most tellingly, to refer to events that are about to occur (e.g. John 6:4). Jesus specifically uses this word in the Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24, Mark 13) and in his similar lecture in Luke 21 to refer to the nearness of events that follow the signs he describes:

> So likewise ye, when ye shall see these things, know that it is **near**, even at the doors.  
>   
> Matthew 24:32 (emphasis added)  

> So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that is is **nigh**, even at the doors  
>   
> Mark 13:29 (emphasis added)  

> So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is **nigh at hand**.  
>   
> Luke 21:31 (emphasis added)  

While *en tachei* earlier did not necessarily imply that the events described herein would occur soon in a temporal sense, the word *eggys* would indeed imply just that, had it been used in that context. Instead, it's used as an exhortation for the readers and hearers to keep the words of this book, because time is short. It seems that if the reader and hearer are blessed **because** time is short, it may simply mean that time spent reading and hearing the words of this book is time spent wisely.

### The Addressees

> John to the seven churches which are in Asia...  
>   
> Revelation 1:4  

It's interesting to note that, while the contents of Revelation are indeed meant to be read by the broader church audience, John specifically addresses it to seven distinct churches. One might argue that since 7 carries the meaning of "completeness" or "perfection" throughout Scripture that this greeting must apply to the church as a whole; however, the phrase "which are in Asia" obviously limits the scope to a specific geographic region.

The seven specific churches, which Jesus will enumerate in a few verses, are:

1. Ephesus
2. Smyrna
3. Pergamos
4. Thyatira
5. Sardis
6. Philadelphia
7. Laodicea

It's important to note that these churches are always mentioned and dealt with in the same order. It's also noteworthy that not all of these churches are mentioned prior to their appearance here in Revelation. Furthermore, significant churches that were extant at the time Revelation was written are *not* mentioned, particularly the church in Jerusalem. Why these seven?

Given the names of these churches and the known locations of them, we can surmise that when John speaks of "Asia" he's speaking specifically of "Asia Minor," or what we would recognize in modern times as Turkey.

### The Trinity

> Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.  
>   
> Revelation 1:4-6  

John includes here a special benediction from the entire Godhead, the Trinity. The Trinity is, of course, comprised of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghost). While some contend that the Trinity as a concept was introduced to the church long after the writing of the New Testament, the truth is that the Trinity is hinted at throughout Scripture, going back to Genesis, where God speaks of himself in the plural sense:

> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness...  
>   
> Genesis 1:26  

Furthermore, all throughout the Old Testament, God is referred to by the Hebrew word *elohim*. The Hebrew root *el* literally means "God," and is used as such in the names of many prominent characters in Scripture: Samuel means "his name is God," Daniel means "God is my judge," Ezekiel means "God strengthens," etc. However, the fact that the Hebrew word ends in the suffix *-im* indicates that it is a plural noun a la *seraphim* or *cherubim* (which refer to angels in the plural sense). Therefore, anytime God is called by the name *elohim*, it testifies that he is a plural being, and yet he is also one God at the same time. In fact, so great an emphasis is laid on this translation that oftentimes the word *elohim* causes a grammatical error in the text, when a plural noun is used in the context of a singular noun.

Some religions, most notably Islam, take issue with the Trinity (and indeed the godhood of Jesus Christ) and assert it is a form of polytheism, whereas the God of the Old Testament (and Allah) is one God. In Judaism this is reflected most strongly in the *Shema*, derived from Deuteronomy 6:4:

> Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.  

The emphasis that God is **one** can be used to argue for a singular entity, rather than a plurality of the same essence, as the Trinity is. However, the Hebrew word *echad*, translated as "one," has multiple meanings. It can mean "one" as in the ordinal number (e.g., "first"), or as in unity or uniqueness (literally "aloneness"). The most popular example of *echad* in Scripture that is used to argue for the Trinity is the usage in Numbers 13:23:

> And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff...  
>   
> Numbers 13:23  

Again, "one" in this verse is the Hebrew *echad*, and since it is referring to a cluster of grapes, some Christians assert that *echad* can mean a sort of "compound unity," which is not altogether different from our understanding of the Trinity.

Perhaps a more compelling illustration of the union derived from *echad* comes in Genesis referring to marriage:

> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.  
>   
> Genesis 2:24  

Marriage, of course, is the act of two distinct persons being joined in one essence (one "flesh").
